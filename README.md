# Burger Eater

A Burger Eater application created with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars.

## Description

The Burger Eater application is a simple full stack application: the front-end was created with HTML and CSS, with the HTML templating generated by Handlebars. Node.js and Express were used for the back-end.

Users input burger names they'd like to eat in the _Add a Burger_ section. Clicking the 'Add Burger' button adds the user's entry to the app's MySQL database and the entry is displayed on the _Burgers I want to eat_ list. Clicking on 'Let's Eat! updates the status of the burger in the database and moves the devoured burger to the _Burgers that I've eaten_ list below.

## Demo
